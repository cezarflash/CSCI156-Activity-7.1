Chapter 7 - day  1: While loops


1. Write a while loop that prints all of the numbers between 1 and 10.

2. Write a while loop that only exits when a user types in q.

3. Write a while loop that exits when the sum of the squares 12 + 22 + 32  + … exceeds an input m. Print the largest sum less than m and the number of terms in the sum.
Example: If m = 18 then 
12 +22 + 32 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
12 +22 + 32 + 42 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30

Therefore you should print out 3 and 14.
